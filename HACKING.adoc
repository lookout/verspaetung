=== Hacking Verspätung

Verspätung is a link:http://groovy-lang.org[Groovy]-based application which is
built with link:http://gradle.org[Gradle]. As such, if you are already familiar
with these tools you should be able to find your way around the project with
relative ease.


A quick primer on what tasks are available:

* Running tests: `./gradlew check`
* Running the app locally: `./gradlew run -PzookeeperHosts=localhost:2181`
* Building the app for distribution: `./gradlew assemble`


=== Releasing Verspätung

NOTE: This is mostly meant for the developer team.

Currently releases can be produced by simply pushing a Git tag to this GitHub
repository. This will cause Travis CI to build and test the tag, which if it is
successful, will automatically publish to
link:https://bintray.com/lookout/systems/verspaetung[Bintray].
